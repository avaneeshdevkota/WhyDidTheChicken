Hello and welcome to Why’d the Chicken? Your objective is to cross as many road and train tracks as possible before being run over. Press the UP, LEFT, RIGHT arrow keys or the W, A, and D keys to move your chicken up, left, and right respectively. You can pause the game at any time by pressing ‘p’ and resume by pressing ‘p’ again. To start the game, either click onto the screen or press the ENTER key. If the chicken dies and you want another shot, you can either click onto the screen or press the ENTER key again!

Keep an eye for valuable power-ups that appear randomly. They are rare but can help you survive just that bit longer! If your chicken turns red after you pick up a Captain America Shield, you have activated the Cautious Chicken Power-up that will help you survive one hit from a car. Sadly even Captain America’s shield cannot save you from a train hit, so be careful! If your chicken turns blue after you pick up a Snowflake, you have activated the Cryo Chicken Power-up that will slow down all the cars for that scene. Looks like the cold makes their engines very inefficient!

Challenge yourself and your friends to see who can cross the most roads and train tracks in this awesomely addicting arcade game!
